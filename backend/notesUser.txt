Documentation:

1. User Auth:
   Register -> Verify OTP -> Login
   using jwt token and cookies

2. Search Functionality (Product Search):
   MongoDB Atlas Search Index Inplemented -> Like Nearest Vendor -> Having product 
   Using Redis Cache
   with cacheInvalidation for UpdateProduct and DeleteProduct Controllers for vendor portal crud

3. Zustand for managing client-side state:
      why need ? Same data fetched multiple times
                 page State dies on navigation
                 currently there's no global truth 
      State management = a single, predictable source of truth for your app’s client-side data

   state =
      search query
      user location
      nearby stores
      selected store
      intent (viewing, navigating, booking)
      auth user/vendor

      Redux	is Too heavy, boilerplate
      Context API	is Re-renders entire tree
      URL state only	is Limited, messy
      ✅**Zustand** is Minimal, fast, scalable
   
   Axios file = “How to talk to backend”
   Zustand store = “What data does the app currently believe is true”
   --They work together

   We added Zustand stores that:
      Call API helpers
      Store the response globally
      Let ANY component read it
      Persist important state if needed
